# RGB-Color-Game

### Description
An interactive game where a user guesses the given RBG color given pixel values.

### Reason for building
I completed this project mainly to practice my front-end web development skills, and also because of my interest in computer vision, in which a thorough understanding of RBG color space is useful. 

### What I learned
- Manipulation of the DOM
- Generating random numbers in a give range using Math.random()
- Building an interactive web appliction using HTML, CSS, JavaScript

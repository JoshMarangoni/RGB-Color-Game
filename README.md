# RGB-Color-Game

### Description
An interactive game where a user guesses the given RBG color given pixel values.

### Reason for building
I completed this project as part of The FullStack Web Development Bootcamp by Colt Steele, mainly to practice my front-end web development skills. This is also a great tool for computer vision developers wanting to familarize themselves with the RBG color space. 

### What I learned
- Manipulation of the DOM
- Generating random numbers in a give range using Math.random()
- Building an interactive web appliction using HTML, CSS, JavaScript

# RGB-Color-Game

### Description
An interactive game where a user guesses the given RBG color given pixel values.

### Reason for building
I completed this project mainly to practice my front-end web development skills, and also because of my interest in computer vision, in which a thorough understanding of RBG color space is useful.
